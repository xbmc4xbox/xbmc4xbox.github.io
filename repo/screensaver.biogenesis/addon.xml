    <description>An implementation of John Conway&apos;s famous &quot;Game of Life&quot; with 3 custom coloring rules. A few basic rules govern which cells will live in the next generation depending on the cells current state and the number of its live neighbors.[CR][CR]Screenshots don&apos;t do this much justice as the motion of the system bordering between stability and chaos is what looks interesting.[CR][CR]Features:[CR] - 3 custom coloring rules are implemented each yielding interesting results.[CR] - Colony coloring color cells depending on the color of its &apos;parent&apos; cells.[CR] - Lifetime coloring colors a cell depending on how long its been alive.[CR] - Neighbor coloring a cell depending on the configuration of its neighbors.[CR] - Many parameters are configurable in the settings.</description>
